# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithm-Visualization
Multiple I/O requests may arrive by different processes and only one I/O request can be served at a time by the disk controller. Thus other I/O requests need to wait in the waiting queue and need to be scheduled. The implemented algorithms in this project are FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, and C-LOOK
